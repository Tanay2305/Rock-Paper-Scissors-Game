## About

This project is a command-line implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The user inputs their choice, and the computer randomly chooses one. The winner is determined based on traditional rules:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

## How to Play

- Run the Python script.
- Enter your choice when prompted:  
  - "s" for Scissors  
  - "p" for Paper  
  - "r" for Rock  
- The game will display your choice, the computer's choice, and the result (win/lose/draw).

## Code Overview

The game uses simple logic where:
- Scissors is represented by 1
- Paper is represented by -1
- Rock is represented by 0

The computer choice is randomly selected from these values, and the result is calculated with conditional checks.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
